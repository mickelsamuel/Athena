# Security Policy

## 🔒 Security Commitment

The Athena Trading Platform takes security seriously. This document outlines our security practices and how to report security vulnerabilities.

## 🛡️ Supported Versions

We provide security updates for the following versions:

| Version | Supported          |
| ------- | ------------------ |
| 0.1.x   | ✅ Yes             |
| < 0.1   | ❌ No              |

## 🚨 Reporting a Vulnerability

**DO NOT** report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues.

### Preferred Method

Please report security vulnerabilities by emailing:
**security@athena-trading.com** (or your preferred contact)

### What to Include

When reporting a security vulnerability, please include:

1. **Description**: Clear description of the vulnerability
2. **Impact**: Potential impact and attack scenarios
3. **Reproduction**: Step-by-step instructions to reproduce
4. **Environment**: Affected versions and configurations
5. **Severity**: Your assessment of the severity level

### Response Timeline

- **Initial Response**: Within 48 hours
- **Triage**: Within 1 week
- **Fix Development**: 2-4 weeks (depending on complexity)
- **Release**: Coordinated disclosure after fix is available

## 🔐 Security Best Practices

### For Users

#### API Keys and Secrets
- **Never commit API keys** to version control
- Use `.env` files for configuration (excluded from git)
- Rotate API keys regularly
- Use testnet/sandbox environments for development

#### Environment Configuration
```bash
# .env file (never commit this)
BINANCE_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
BINANCE_SECRET_KEY=your_secret_key_here
ATHENA_LOG_LEVEL=INFO
```

#### Network Security
- Use HTTPS for all API communications
- Validate SSL certificates
- Implement proper timeout configurations
- Use VPN when accessing trading APIs from public networks

#### Access Control
- Run with minimal required permissions
- Use dedicated trading accounts with limited funds
- Enable two-factor authentication on exchange accounts
- Regularly review account permissions and access logs

### For Developers

#### Code Security
- **Input Validation**: Validate all user inputs
- **SQL Injection**: Use parameterized queries (if applicable)
- **Path Traversal**: Validate file paths and restrict access
- **Dependency Management**: Keep dependencies updated

#### Secrets Management
```python
# ✅ Good: Use environment variables
import os
api_key = os.getenv('BINANCE_API_KEY')

# ❌ Bad: Hardcoded secrets
api_key = 'hardcoded_key_here'
```

#### Error Handling
```python
# ✅ Good: Don't expose sensitive info in errors
try:
    result = api_call()
except AuthenticationError:
    logger.error("Authentication failed")
    raise ValueError("Invalid credentials")

# ❌ Bad: Exposing sensitive information
except AuthenticationError as e:
    raise ValueError(f"API key {api_key} failed: {e}")
```

## 🛠️ Security Features

### Data Protection
- **Local Caching**: Market data cached locally to reduce API calls
- **No Credential Storage**: API keys not stored in application files
- **Encrypted Communications**: HTTPS/WSS for all external communications
- **Input Validation**: All user inputs validated and sanitized

### Access Control
- **Read-only by Default**: Most operations are read-only
- **Explicit Trading Mode**: Live trading requires explicit configuration
- **Testnet Support**: Full testnet support for safe testing

### Monitoring and Logging
- **Structured Logging**: Security events logged with structured format
- **No Sensitive Data**: Credentials never logged
- **Error Tracking**: Security-relevant errors tracked and monitored

## 🚫 Known Security Considerations

### Trading Risks
- **Market Risk**: All trading involves financial risk
- **API Limits**: Respect exchange rate limits to avoid bans
- **Paper Trading**: Use paper trading for strategy development

### Technical Limitations
- **Local Storage**: Cache files stored in plain text (market data only)
- **Memory**: Sensitive data may remain in memory during execution
- **Network**: Communications subject to network monitoring

## 🔧 Security Configuration

### Recommended Settings

```python
# athena/core/config.py
SECURITY_SETTINGS = {
    "max_request_retries": 3,
    "request_timeout": 30,
    "verify_ssl": True,
    "log_sensitive_data": False,
}
```

### Environment Variables

| Variable | Purpose | Required | Default |
|----------|---------|----------|---------|
| `ATHENA_LOG_LEVEL` | Logging level | No | `INFO` |
| `ATHENA_DATA_DIR` | Data directory | No | `./data_cache` |
| `BINANCE_API_KEY` | Binance API key | For live trading | None |
| `BINANCE_SECRET_KEY` | Binance secret | For live trading | None |

### Docker Security

```yaml
# docker-compose.yml security considerations
services:
  dashboard:
    # Don't run as root
    user: "1000:1000"

    # Read-only environment files
    volumes:
      - ./.env:/app/.env:ro

    # Restrict capabilities
    cap_drop:
      - ALL

    # Use non-privileged port
    ports:
      - "8050:8050"
```

## 📊 Security Monitoring

### Automated Checks

Our CI/CD pipeline includes:

- **Dependency Scanning**: Check for known vulnerabilities
- **Code Analysis**: Static analysis for security issues
- **Secret Detection**: Scan for accidentally committed secrets
- **License Compliance**: Verify dependency licenses

### Manual Reviews

- Security-focused code reviews for all changes
- Regular dependency audits
- Penetration testing (for production deployments)

## 🚀 Security Updates

### Notification Channels

Security updates announced via:
- GitHub Security Advisories
- Release notes (for public issues)
- Direct communication (for critical issues)

### Update Process

1. **Assessment**: Evaluate impact and urgency
2. **Development**: Create fix with minimal changes
3. **Testing**: Comprehensive testing including security scenarios
4. **Release**: Coordinated release with clear upgrade instructions

2. **Assessment**: Evaluate scope and impact
3. **Containment**: Prevent further damage
4. **Communication**: Notify affected users (if any)
5. **Recovery**: Restore secure operations
6. **Lessons Learned**: Update security measures

## 📝 Compliance
