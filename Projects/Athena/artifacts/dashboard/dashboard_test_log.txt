Dashboard Testing Log
===================

Test: Dashboard functionality validation
Status: ⚠️  SKIPPED - Dashboard implementation placeholder

Details:
- Dashboard command exists in CLI (athena.cli.main:dashboard)
- Current implementation shows: "Dashboard coming soon with Dash/Plotly integration!"
- Dashboard is not fully implemented yet
- Would require Dash/Plotly setup for full functionality testing

Recommendation:
- Dashboard infrastructure is in place
- Ready for future Dash/Plotly integration
- CLI command structure is correct

Note: This is expected behavior as dashboard is marked as "coming soon" in the current implementation.
